# Quaver
A Java based programmer's notebook designed using the [Quiver Data Format](https://github.com/HappenApps/Quiver/wiki/Quiver-Data-Format Quiver Data Format Github) (based on [HappenApps Quiver: The Programmer's Notebook](http://happenapps.com/#quiver Quiver Homepage))

## What is Quaver
I originally saw on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11009996 Hacker News Article) of a notebook designed for programmers. I was bummed that it was only supported on Mac and iOS. So I have taken it upon myself to build a cross platform version of the original Quiver software using Java and the open data format used in HappenApps Quiver.

## Why open source?
I love the idea of customisation of software to your particuar needs and preferences. Thus I will release a .jar with all the default settings and configurations. If you are more adventurous and either want to learn how the software works, criticise my work or make a custom version of the program you are more than welcome to make it what you want. Support for the project is appreciated as this is all experimental and I am a solo team.
