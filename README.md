# Quaver
A Java based programmer's notebook designed using the Quiver Data Format (based on HappenApps Quiver: The Programmer's Notebook)

## What is Quaver
I originally saw on Hacker News of a notebook designed for programmers. I was bummed that it was only supported on Mac and iOS. So I have taken it upon myself to build a cross platform version of the original Quiver software using Java and the open data format used in HappenApps Quiver.
