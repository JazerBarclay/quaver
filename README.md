# Quaver
A Java based programmer's notebook designed using the [Quiver Data Format](https://github.com/HappenApps/Quiver/wiki/Quiver-Data-Format "Quiver Data Format Github") (based on [HappenApps Quiver: The Programmer's Notebook](http://happenapps.com/#quiver "Quiver Homepage"))

## What is Quaver
I originally saw on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11009996 "Hacker News Article") of a notebook designed for programmers. I was bummed that it was only supported on Mac and iOS. So I have taken it upon myself to build a cross platform version of the original Quiver software using Java and the open data format used in HappenApps Quiver.

## Why open source?
I love the idea of customisation of software to your particuar needs and preferences. Thus I will release a .jar with all the default settings and configurations. If you are more adventurous and either want to learn how the software works, criticise my work or make a custom version of the program you are more than welcome to make it what you want. 

## Support the project

You can also send some love by tweeting me @_nythril or follow on discord. I am setting up a channel for those that want to keep a close eye on the project with commit updates pushed to it and links provided for quick downloads and screenshots. Issues can be added and pinned as bugs will turn up. Support for the project is appreciated as this is all experimental and I am a solo team.
